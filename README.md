# Rustworld
A Rimworld-inspired, Rust-powered game. Top-down colony management sim in which you can direct your colonists.

# V0.1.0:
  - Camera functionality:
    * Middle mouse to pan camera
    * Mouse wheel to zoom in and out
  - Actors:
    * "Lemmy" is my 'placeholder' character, courtesy of my wife Lauren.
    * He can be told to move to a location by right-clicking. If he is unable to reach the location, he will not move.
    * Lemmy cannot swim, so he will avoid water.
  - Walls:
    * Walls can be placed on the map by left-clicking.
    * They can be removed by clicking on them again.
    * Try creating a maze and having Lemmy navigate it!
